# First Setup Toolkit

This simple Bash script automates the installation of multiple applications during system setup, allowing users to choose which applications to install.

## Usage

1. Copy the project to your computer:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gokhangunduz/first-setup
   cd first-setup
   chmod +x ./setup.sh
   ```

2. Run the initial setup:

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   This command prepares your system, installs necessary dependencies, and prompts you to choose which applications to install.

3. In the dialog window, select the applications you want to install and click the "OK" button.

4. The selected applications will be automatically installed.
